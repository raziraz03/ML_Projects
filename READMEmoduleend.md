Dataset is loaded using pandas csv
Data preprocessing has be done to make sure no null values and duplicate values are not there
skewness was checked and there was skewness for four columns which was above 1
skewness was handled using log and boxcox method
later that data is divided into test and train 
then the data is given to 
1)Linear Regression
2) Decision Tree Regressor
3) Random Forest Regressor
4) Gradient Boosting Regressor
5) Support Vector Regressor
and models was created 
once thats done has used 3 methods like R2,MAE,MSE to check the acquiracy
Then hyper tunning was perfoemd to make sure whihc algoritham and parameters can give the best result

outliers was found and it was removed 
Then log method was used to bring the data to the range
Then minmax scaler was found 
Then data was splittd to test and train where test data was 0.2
Then regression methods where used to  create models
Linear Regression
Decission Tree
Random Forest Regressor
Gradient Boosting Regressor
Support Vector Regressor (SVR)
Then MOdel was evaluated with certian methods to check the error or how it is performed
